## Project Overview

The **Data Retrieval Project** provides examples and reusable code snippets for retrieving data across various online sources, including:
- HTML-based websites through web scraping
- APIs via HTTP requests
- HTTPS protocol parsing for secure data access

This project is ideal for learning how to collect data from the web, integrate APIs, and parse content for data analytics or application development.

## Features

- **HTML Parsing**: Uses libraries like BeautifulSoup to navigate and extract HTML elements.
- **HTTPS Requests**: Demonstrates secure HTTP requests to access web pages or data behind HTTPS protocols.
- **API Integration**: Shows how to make HTTP requests to APIs and handle JSON data formats.
- **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for network errors, unavailable data, or parsing issues.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **BeautifulSoup**: For HTML parsing and web scraping
- **Requests**: For making HTTPS requests and API calls
- **JSON**: For parsing API responses

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azizbentaleb/Data_preparation.git
   cd Data_preparation

   ```

2. **Install required libraries**:
